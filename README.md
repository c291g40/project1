This is the readme file for the first project assignment in c291.  

Note: Remember to put 2 spaces at the end of each line to create a new line.

Issues:  
    updatimeTime:
        There is an error in entering time input. No matter what the input is (within the 24 hour time boundaries), There is a message saying, Invalid entry.  
    search.py:  
        Could not test search.py from home(errors with query) but managed to test via ssh.
        I think the specs mention that we need to select a flight from the results of the search but i don't see that imlemented.  
    
    Use these calls to make a booking:  
        import booking  
    
        booking = booking.booking(connectionString)  
         booking.book1WayFromSelection(email, flightNo, depDate, fareType)  
        OR  
    	book2WayFromSelection(email, FlightNo1, depDate1, fare1,FlightNo2, depDate2, fare2):
